# 🧥 Lions x TEP: Scaling Social Impact Through Strategic Sponsorship

This project presents a strategic sponsorship proposal developed for **The Empowerment Plan (TEP)** in collaboration with the **Detroit Lions Foundation**. Created as part of the *Communicating with Impact* module at Hult International Business School, the project aimed to secure multi-year funding for TEP—a Detroit-based nonprofit employing unhoused individuals to produce sleeping bag coats that double as emergency shelter.

## 🧠 Project Overview

TEP is tackling generational homelessness by offering employment, skills training, and dignified income to vulnerable populations. Our team was tasked with developing an emotionally compelling, data-backed case for increased sponsorship from the Lions Foundation—and later adapted it into a grant proposal for the Gates Foundation.

This repository features:
- Impact storytelling & strategic narrative design  
- Transparent budget breakdown  
- Sponsorship value articulation  
- Alignment with UN SDGs and corporate CSR mandates
